I am a current Master's student at the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/). My specialization is Coastal Marine Resources Management, with a focus in Environmental Data Science. My interests and research revolve around small scale fisheries management and ocean health. Currently, I work with a team of scientists at [The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) on a project called the [Ocean Health Index](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/).
